          Foundations
        </h3>
        <div class="row d-flex col-12">
          <p class="col-12">
            At one point, for reasons I won’t get into, I started to question why I worked and why I was here.
          </p>
          <p class="col-12">
            I searched, but it appears there is no way to know why humans exist because there are limits to human knowledge. We cannot understand why we are here when we do not even know where our place is in the universe or throughout time.
          </p>
          <p class="col-12">
            The limit to human knowledge led me to contemplate, what I was supposed to do with my time if I didn't know why I existed. Throughout history, humans, and life in general have always acted to survive. Maybe I could help humanity survive long enough for someone to find its purpose. Perhaps furthering survival was my purpose.
          </p>
          <p class="col-12">
            To make sure society survives long enough to discover its reason, humans need to be more environmentally sustainable. The production of goods needs to be circular if humans are going to have enough time to make scientific advancements.
          </p>
          <p class="col-12">
            My first inclination was to create new products from the waste of other goods. Similar to nature, a circular system is the only way to continue producing at the current rate. However, because of my business background, it is unlikely that I will invent new materials or manufacturing methods. Perhaps my purpose is to help others achieve sustainable change.
          </p>
          <p class="col-12">
            Supporting engineers and scientists is why I got into product management. I see my job as an opportunity to assist others who might make society better. I learned many engineers and business people often clash, but I always found math and science to be second nature. I chose to bridge the gap between technology and business by becoming a Product Manager. By creating efficient business models, I can magnify the positive impact of new technology by ensuring scales to reach all the people it can help.
          </p>
          <p class="col-12">
            Since no single discovery is going to determine the fate of humanity, it is essential that as many useful ideas as possible thrive. There are a lot of prominent problems in the world, which need more people to solve them. At the same time, many humans go their whole lives without being able to do anything other than work to ensure their health and safety. Valuable ideas come from anywhere, which is why I view poverty as a waste of human resources. To solve society's most significant dilemmas, everyone should have the option to contribute. By realizing that poverty subjugates many people on the planet, I expanded my thinking beyond sustainable production and into human well-being.
          </p>
          <p class="col-12">
            Part of my mission is to ensure equal access to opportunity. I started to learn about the systemic and often hidden hindrances to human actualization. At first, I focused on impoverished areas throughout Africa, South America, and Asia. However, I later learned about obstacles faced by people in the United States, such as a lack of food, inadequate healthcare, and social injustice. Alleviating these issues, so each person has an equal opportunity to succeed, is a critical part of attaining a sustainable future.
          </p>
          <p class="col-12">
            From the middle of college on, my mission became to beget sustainable production methods and equal access to opportunity. Often, people assume that by discussing lofty topics I expect to be the savior of humanity. However, the point is not to be the sole guardian; it is to see the big picture and find an individual place in it. I endeavor to be one of the billions across space and time who generate more life by creating an increasingly sustainable future. I do what I can with what I have, and do not delude myself into thinking that I have done my best, even when I have not. It’s this thought that keeps me going when it would be more comfortable to lay back and imagine humanity’s future is out of my control.
          </p>
          <p class="col-12">
            I am looking for a company to put my energy into and know that I have moved humanity one step closer toward a sustainable future.

          Actions & Identity
        </h3>
        <div class="row d-flex col-12">
          <p class="col-12">
            On a much smaller scale, I realized that my privileged position at a prominent private school meant I did not have many repercussions for my actions, mainly my inaction. In other words, I found I could be lazy in college. If I focused on myself and my comfort, I would go on being as healthy as ever. It was easy to let myself fall into habits like hanging out with people rather than working.
          </p>
          <p class="col-12">
            It may sound odd, but without societal pressure, I lost my sense of how I wanted to act. Social forces shape many behaviors. Without them, I was adrift in regards to the type of person to be. It was uncomfortable because I had no compass for the sort of person I wanted to become.
          </p>
          <p class="col-12">
            I found that books held the answer. A friend of mine recommended The Fountainhead by Ayn Rand, because she thought I reminded her of the main character Howard Roark. I read the book and realized that Ayn Rand was right in many regards. Howard Roark was a guidepost for me and how I wanted to act.
          </p>
          <p class="col-12">
            Later, I came across Plato’s Republic. It instilled values like that work should always be done in service to others, doing one’s job without getting in the way of others’ work is justice, and that a just life is a happier one.
          </p>
          <p class="col-12">
            Elon Musk’s biography is where I discovered how to enact my values in a modern context.
          </p>
          <p class="col-12">
            There are many other books which shape my model for everyday life, and I regularly find more. Lab Girl and Hillbilly Elegy presented useful ideas about who I wanted to act under stress. (If you’re curious, War & Peace, Letters from a Stoic, and the Inheritance Cycle are good as well.)
          </p>
          <p class="col-12">
            For more about me on an individual basis, you can look at some of the role models I hold as core parts of my identity.

          <li><strong><em>Letters from a Stoic</em></strong> for the small things.</li>
          <li><strong><em>The Inheritance Cycle</em></strong> has beautifully illustrated stoic characters.</li>
          <li><strong><em>Diary from a Russian Gulag</em></strong> keeps the picture of what humans can endure in perspective.</li>
          <li><strong><em>Letters to a Young Poet</em></strong> - not convincing, but a good reaffirmation if you already agree with the advice.</li>
          <li><strong><em>Lab Girl</em></strong> because of how to face poverty</li>
          <li><strong><em>Hillbilly Elegy</em></strong> because of how to be responsible</li>
