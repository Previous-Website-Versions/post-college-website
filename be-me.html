            At one point, I started to ask the question, “why do I exist?” After a long search, I concluded there was <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/06/03/tolstoy-confession/">no real way to know</a> because there are limits on human knowledge. In place of a definitive answer, I made my aspiration to help humanity reach a point when it might one day discover its meaning.

          <p class="col-12">
            Today, I strive to make the <a href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/">United Nations Sustainable Development Goals</a> a reality. I look for ways to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_economy">make the economy circular</a> and ensure environmental sustainability. I endeavor to get everyone equal access to opportunity so that the best ideas can flourish.
          </p>
          <p class="col-12">
            Both desires push me toward a career in Product Management, where I create products to achieve those goals. I am always searching for ways to effectuate efficient systems, accessible information, and universal health.

            On a much smaller scale, I realized that my privileged position at a prominent private school meant I did not have many repercussions laziness. If I focused on myself and my comfort, I could go on living as healthy as ever. It was easy to let myself fall into poor habits, such as socializing rather than working.
          </p>
          <p class="col-12">
            It may sound odd, but without societal pressure, I lost my sense of how to act. Social forces shape many behaviors, and without them, I was adrift regarding the person I wanted to become.
          </p>
          <p class="col-12">
            Eventually, I found books could be my guide. A friend of mine recommended <em>The Fountainhead</em> by Ayn Rand. She thought I reminded her of the protagonist, Howard Roark. I read the book and realized that Ayn Rand was right in many regards, "there are few guideposts," but Howard Roark was one of them. He provided a much-needed role model in a time of uncertainty.
          </p>
          <p class="col-12">
            Later, I came across Plato’s <em>Republic</em>. It instilled values like work should always be done in service to others, doing one’s work without getting in the way of others’ is justice, and that a just life is a better one.
          </p>
          <p class="col-12">
            Elon Musk’s biography is where I discovered how to enact my values in a modern context. He took his desire to prolong human existence and created a viable business based on sustainability.
          </p>
          <p class="col-12">
            Many other books shape my personality, and I regularly find more. <em>Lab Girl</em> and <em>Hillbilly Elegy</em> present useful examples of how to gracefully shoulder stress. (If you’re curious, <em>War & Peace</em>, <em>Letters from a Stoic</em>, and <em>The Inheritance Cycle</em> are good as well.)

          <li><strong><em>The Inheritance Cycle</em></strong> has beautifully illustrated stoic characters.</li>
          <li><strong><em>Diary from a Russian Gulag</em></strong> keeps the picture of what humans can endure in perspective.</li>
          <li><strong><em>Letters to a Young Poet</em></strong> - not convincing, but a good reaffirmation if you already agree with the advice.</li>
          <li><strong><em>Lab Girl</em></strong> because of how to face poverty</li>
